# Fotmob Data Scraping

In data science, if you are interested in football, it is more fun to work with real-life data. If you want to practice with current match data and if you are a beginner at this, you need to scrape data. In this project, you will find a script to scrape match data from Fotmob. After scraping, you will convert it into a dataframe (meaning table in Python) and then create a simple visualization from it.
